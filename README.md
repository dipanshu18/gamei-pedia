# Gamei Pedia

This project is aimed towards exploring API for dynamic data of the video games which is provided by RAWG. We have a SPA of upcoming releases, popular releases, and currently released information on the video games with appropriate thumbnails and in-game screenshots for giving the user an overview of the game.

This also includes search functionality in which the user can search for a specific video game and upon the search results user can explore the page. All this action is performed under minimal page reloads with the use of react-router and state management using redux.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
